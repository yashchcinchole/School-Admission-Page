    <h1>Introduction :</h1>
    <p1 class="custom-paragraph"></p1>
    <p1>Private schools are owned and governed by entities that are independent of
        any government—typically, religious bodies or independent boards of trustees. Private schools also receive funding primarily from nonpublic sources:
        tuition payments and often other private sources, such as foundations, religious bodies, alumni, or other private donors. In contrast, state and local
        education agencies (districts) and publicly elected or appointed school boards
        govern public schools. At some schools, parent/teacher organizations or similar groups also play a role. Public schools receive nearly all their funding
        from local, state, and federal governments, supplemented occasionally by
        grants/donations from corporations and foundations, and parent- or studentinitiated fundraising activities.</p1><br>
        <p1>Choice is another defining characteristic of private schools: families choose
            private education, and private schools may choose which students to accept.
            In contrast, public school districts generally assign students to particular
            schools, and those schools usually accept all students assigned. However,
            public school systems are expanding school choice options through magnet
            and charter schools, open enrollment, and similar offerings, and, in a few
            instances, through publicly funded vouchers. Families with sufficient financial resources have always been able to choose a public school by choosing
            where to live, but school choice options are also increasingly available for
            others. Thus, public school districts are sometimes selective about who attends specific schools, and families may have some choice within the public sector as well. The proportion of public school children attending a chosen
            school (rather than the school assigned by residence location) has increased
            in recent years (indicator 29, U.S. Department of Education 2002). In 1999,
            for example, 16 percent of public school students in grades 1–12 attended a
            school the family had chosen, up from 12 percent in 1993.</p1>
